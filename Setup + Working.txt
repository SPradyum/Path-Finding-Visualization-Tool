This is a Python program that creates a graphical interface for a grid-based search algorithm.

Algorithm : Dijkstra Algorithm 

Setup:
Things you require to run this code are:
1. Python Supporter IDE (recommended - Visual Studio Code)
2. Python installed on your computer
3. Installing 'pygame' library (run this command in the IDE Terminal : pip install pygame)

Working:
1. It uses two libraries, pygame for graphics and tkinter for creating message boxes.

2. It sets up a window of size 800x800 pixels using pygame.

3. It defines the size of the grid as 50x50 boxes within this window.

4. It creates a grid of boxes and sets up some attributes for each box, like whether it's a start point, a wall, or a target.

5. You can draw walls and set a target by clicking and right-clicking with your mouse within the grid.

6. When you press a key, it starts a search algorithm to find a path from the start box to the target box. It uses a breadth-first search algorithm.

7. It continuously updates the display to show the grid, with different colors for visited boxes, the path found, walls, and the start/target boxes.

8. If there's no path to the target, it displays a message box saying "There is no solution."

What's Next?
After running the code you try to figure out setting the end point or destination point after constructing the obstacles. To place the end point or destination you use 'Right-Click" of your mouse or trackpad.

In summary, this code creates a visual representation of a grid-based search algorithm where you can set up obstacles and a target, and it finds a path from a starting point to the target, displaying the process on the screen.
