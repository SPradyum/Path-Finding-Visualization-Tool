This is a Python program that creates a graphical interface for a grid-based search algorithm.

Setup:
Things you require to run this code are:
1. Python Supporter IDE (recommended - Visual Studio Code)
2. Python installed on your computer
3. Installing 'pygame' library (run this command in the IDE Terminal : pip install pygame)

Working:
1. It uses two libraries, pygame for graphics and tkinter for creating message boxes.

2. It sets up a window of size 800x800 pixels using pygame.

3. It defines the size of the grid as 50x50 boxes within this window.

4. It creates a grid of boxes and sets up some attributes for each box, like whether it's a start point, a wall, or a target.

5. You can draw walls and set a target by clicking and right-clicking with your mouse within the grid.

6. When you press a key, it starts a search algorithm to find a path from the start box to the target box. It uses a breadth-first search algorithm.

7. It continuously updates the display to show the grid, with different colors for visited boxes, the path found, walls, and the start/target boxes.

8. If there's no path to the target, it displays a message box saying "There is no solution."

In summary, this code creates a visual representation of a grid-based search algorithm where you can set up obstacles and a target, and it finds a path from a starting point to the target, displaying the process on the screen.
