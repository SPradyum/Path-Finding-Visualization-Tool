Path Finding Visualization Tool
Description:

Experience the power of the Dijkstra Algorithm in action with our interactive Python-based visualization project. This project offers a dynamic and user-friendly interface for understanding the renowned Dijkstra Algorithmâ€”a fundamental tool in graph theory for finding the shortest path between nodes.

Key Features:

1. Graphical Visualization: The project provides a visually engaging grid-based environment where users can set up their own custom obstacles and define a start and target node.

2. Dijkstra Algorithm: Behind the scenes, the project employs the Dijkstra Algorithm to efficiently compute the shortest path from the starting point to the target while avoiding obstacles.

3. Real-time Updates: As the algorithm progresses, you can watch the grid come to life with colors representing different states: visited nodes, the path found, walls, and more.

4. Intuitive User Controls: Drawing walls and specifying the target location are as simple as clicking within the grid, making it accessible for users of all levels.

5. Informative Alerts: If no viable path exists, the project displays a user-friendly message, ensuring a seamless and informative user experience.

Whether you're a computer science enthusiast, a student studying algorithms, or simply curious about how the Dijkstra Algorithm works, this project provides an interactive and educational platform to explore pathfinding in action. Gain insights into the intricacies of this algorithm as it calculates optimal routes, and witness the magic of efficient graph traversal.
